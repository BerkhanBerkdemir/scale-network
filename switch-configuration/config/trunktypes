# Trunktypes file -- This file defines VLAN lists for certain types of trunks which
# can be referenced in switch types (types/*) files in Trunk Port declarations
#
# Format: <name>\t<vlan>[,<vlan>...]\t<bgcolor>\t<fgcolor>
#
# where <name> is an arbitrary name (which should not match a VLAN name
# 	<vlan> is a vlan name defined in vlans or one of its includes.
#	<bgcolor> is a 0xRRGGBB value defining a background color for such interfaces
#	<fgcolor> is a 0xRRGGBB value defining the text color for such interfaces
#
# If a <name> overlaps a <vlan>, then types files will interpret it as a
# name and expand it based on the definition here. Expansions here are not
# recursive, so any vlan here will not be treated as a name, even if it conflicts.
#
# This makes it possible to work around conflicts, but will be very confusing and
# is thus, best avoided.

// Uplink definition can be used for both Uplink and Downlink ports, but different colors
// are desirable, so we define them separately here.
