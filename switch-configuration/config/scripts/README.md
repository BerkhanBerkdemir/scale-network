# Switch Configuration Scripts

Part of [SCaLE's](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/) on-site expo network configurations, tooling and scripts 

## Scripts
* build_switch_configs.pl
-- This should be the first script you run in the tool chain. It will create the output directory if it doesn't exist. It will clean it out if it does. Then it will generate all of the switch configuration files. It will also produce the EPS files that can be combined/printed to produce human-readable port references for the tops of the switches. If you give it any arguments, it will treat those as switch names and generate only those files.

* generate_ps_maps.pl
-- This script will take the EPS files generated by the build_switch_configs.pl and generate a printable postscript file. It will place 5 switch maps per page formatted for a landscape 11x17" printer page.

* switch_template.pl
-- This script should not be directly executed. It is a collection of library functions to support build_switch_config.pl. Most of the actual work occurs inside these library functions.

* switch_pinger
-- This script attempts to ping every switch and displays the status of each one.

* load_switch.py
-- WIP -- Not currently used.

* update_switches
-- WIP -- Not currently used. Probably will get deprecated in favor of Ansible rather than completed.

* override_switches
-- Loads new configuration onto switches, completely replacing existing configuration.
--- Can use -l flag as follows:
---- Build switch configurations (See build_switch_configs.pl above)
---- Set an interface on your system to an appropriate address (contact a senior team member for more information).
---- Connect that interface to the management port of the target switch.
---- Use the command as "override_switches -l <switch_name>" e.g. "override_switches -l NOC" if you are connected to the NOC switch.
---- USE CAUTION: This will load the configuration for the specified <switch_name> onto whatever switch you are connected to.
--- Can take group names as arguments. For example, group F (Ballroom F IDF and dependents) will replace configurations on NW-IDF, BallroomDE, BallroomF, BallroomG, BallroomH
